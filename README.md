If you just want to program your own basys3, you can just download the top.bit bitstream and use vivado to program your board.

## usage
Visual output is done through a vga monitor. Connect the basys3 to the monitor using a vga cable.


### gamecube controller
You can connect a gamecube controller directly to the basys3 board using a home-made connection
